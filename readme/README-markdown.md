# MARKDOWN

## Headings

Add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.

```
# Title level 1
## Title level 2
### Title level 3
```

Preformatted titles, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

```
Title level 1
=============

Title level 2
-------------
```

## Line breaks

Add 2 or more spaces at end of a line.

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses ().

```
[Duck duck go](https://duckduckgo.com)
```

Enclose in angle brackeds (< >) for quick links and email addresses.

### Link formatting

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks in the brackets.

## Bold text

Add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

## Italic text

Add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

## Bold and italic text

Add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

## Block codes

Add a greater than symbol, > in front of a paragraph. For mulitple lines, add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.  
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

## List

You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

### Ordered list

Add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one. When first item is number two, then the list starts with number 2.

### Unordered list

Add dashes (-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.  
If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.  
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.

## Code blocks

Normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

## Images

An exclaimation mark followed by link markdown.

```
![duckduckgo](https://localhost/image.png)
```

### And link to an image

Enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

```
[![duckduckgo](https://localhost/image.png)]
```

## Code

Start with double backticks (`) and end with double backticks.

For multiple line code blocks, indent every line with 4 spaces or tab.

## Horizontal rule

Use 3 or more asteriks (\*), or dashes (-)

## Escaping characters

Add a backslash (\) in front of the character.
